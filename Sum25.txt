In this video I am going to review Nokia company . Nokia is a telecommunications company itself . Company rating is 4.2 which means simplyyou can assume this is one of the betterplace company available in the market . 86 percent of the employees arerecommending their friends to join in this company 93 percent of employeesare recommending their friends . Nokia also provides jobs to almost every engineering folks like Triple A folks like CS folks and DCA folks it is easy andeasy and triply would be the core because it also manufactures electronics .
