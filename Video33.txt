frominstrumentation we were three people anduh about chemical I have no idea okay sookay so you three got placed in worldlycompany from instrumentation Departmentyes okay and what is the strength ofinstrumentation Departmentcurrently the strength ofinstrumentation department is 250student 252 to 70 students greatyou get to know about a worldly companyfrom your TPU right so what was theprocedure from starting to end like youcan brief me about ityeah so first of all as uh likesimilarly company like company mail uhand then uh basically there were threerounds the first was aptitude uh secondwas the GD round that is groupdiscussion and it was followed by thefinal interviewso yeah basically uhthere was an uh like I guess one or oneand a half month uh time was requiredfor all the three procedures okay butthey took around one and a half monthsto complete all the processokay so I uh in which month it came forthe placementin month of January I guessso and you and when you got your offerlateror like at least a first call off likeyou have been selected somethinguh in February 2019 or 20 February uhminus election it was displayed okaygreatso uh yeah so after TPL let you knowthat the world is coming to our campusthen what was uh your procedure ofpreparation like as you tell they theytook firstly they took the aptitudeuh after that they took the interviewand okay group discussion and after thatthey took the interviewokay interview was like there are twolike a chart interviewer different ortechnical both are different or in asingle interview[Music]technical interviewso what was like can you tell us aboutthe aptitude like how was it like it wasit difficult what kind of questions youfinduh no aptitude was quite amazed like uhaccording to your stream the questionswere distributed so logical questionswere say were same for the all thestreams but uh like for mechanical orinstrumentation some two parts werethere first one was logical and theother was according to a stream souh you like uh for whichever stream youbelong according to your stream thequestions were asked for an aptitudealso uh then there was a groupdiscussion uh for group discussion asimple non-technical topic they give anduh yeah they given five minutes time forPreparation and then uh like you need todiscuss uh your points or you need to uhpresent your points on a particulartopic they give the topic is absolutelylike easy it is non-technical topic somost of the students uh like go throughit and the fact then uh like interviewsaccording to our stream visual okayso uh can you explain like how someonecan prepare for the aptitude GD andinterview for Worley companylike how they should prepareyeah so the basic requirement forPreparation is like you need to know allyour like uh from whichever stream youare applying you need to know the basicinformation about likeall the basic knowledge of your uhstream which is from all from scrapitself like we need we need not to likethey directly don't ask as your freshersso they directly don't ask the questionswhich are uh like industry level like orwhich on means after joining on whichyou are going to perform so there isabsolutely a training period of aparticularyour position is graduate engineeringtraining so the first thing is like allthe basic or scrap knowledge about yourstreamwhich is uh for an aptitude also thebasic information is asked okay so uhthere was uh questions from coreinstrumentation in aptitudeinstrumentation our thumbs and uh likethe basic questions about coreinstrumentation okay and was there somegeneral questions like General uhknowledge or like some general aptitudelike train and board problem speed andtimeit's not like that but some logicalquestionsokay like grammatical questions were notthem like much but the core and logicalquestions were bit related in aptitudeokayyes pleaseyeah in and then the second round is ourgroup discussion round where uh like anon-technical uh topic is given to youand you need to elaborate your pointsaccording to the topic given so what wasyour GD topic and what was your uh likewhat were your strategy to uhpass through the GD round becausepersonally I found it difficult in GDuh yeah basically like a foreignforeignrelated to that the topics was given soyeah and basically anytime when we giveGD for any of the companies I think theone of the most important thing theyfocus on is the confidence while youtalk or while you give your answers oryou elaborate your point that is likeyour they see your confidence more thanyour communication skills communicationskills do matter but if you are like ifyou are good to present your point or orif you are successful in delivering yourthoughts to the other party then your GDwill be cracked over themI think so and my strategy was like myparents are government teachers so likeI gave an example so I closely watchabout like how they were facing issuesrelated due to kovid in their educationso I uh elaborated some of the examplesuh which I saw in our daily lives andalso we were facing that those issuesumwas them so through some of the examplesand uh everything else I delivered mythoughts which were uh there on thetopic okay so was you aggressive likewill you suggest to someone to becomeaggressive or just assertive in the GDoh no no no likeuh they also wanted to see acommunication skills and do they alsonotice your listening capabilityso if you are uh good in listeningothers point we it is not a debatedebateso it is in group discussion so we needto discuss our thoughts and we need notto argue over therefully explain the tips to crack the GDso whoever watching whoever peoplewatching this video they will be reallybenefited from your experience and yourstrategy to crack the GDsthank you okay yes so you said that uhafter uh they took your interview downso what uh so just please explain usabout your uh how was your interview andhow you cracked it like what was yourstrategy like most of the people haveare afraid of inter technical interviewbecause in multinational company theytake your knowledge in all thedirections so just please let us knowabout the your interview experience ofworldly companyoh yeah like uh unlike other companiesuh our interview like every for everyfreshers the interview started with yourintroduction basic introduction so Ithink the company uh the uh HR or theperson who is taking interview uh expectthat uh we give and short and sweetintroduction about our personal lifelike our personal things they are notinterested more in your personal uhintroduction like what your mother dodoes or what your father does or whatkind of stream is your sister or brotherperson but they like just a shortintroduction about your personal thingsand a brief introduction about youreducational background or in which fieldyou are studying or what are your uhspecial Specialties about like in aparticular stream or have you donetraining before or have you doneinternship and what projects you areworking on what on what projects you arelike uh done like uh in your final yearsor the uh while you're educationalcurriculum which projects you've done orany like things in which you haveparticipated your co-curricularactivities also uh are the major part inyour like introduction okay so I so youmean that the suitable answer to what uhtell me about yourself is a mixingmixing of curricular and co-curricularactivities like you should queue all thedetails about your curricularco-curricular activity what not you havedone anywhere we takeyeah because the other like theinterviews start on the answers whichyou are giving on your first questionslike great pointsI have uh gave an introduction about myprojects and internship as well so thequestions were started from uh likethere itself so what projects you did orwhich uh uh like which mechanism youused in those projects and so thequestions uh they askedlike starts with the answers you give tothem okayso uh what were some technical questionslike you tell you told about yourinternship and your project so do theyask mostly on projector internship likehow was the flow of interviewuh and uh my like about being aninstrumentation engineer I haveperformed um Merchant and PLC or scadabased project so they were moreinterested in those schools sothey proceeded with the projects or likewhat projects you did or which mechanismor which sensors you used so the basicprinciples of two sensors or like youhave did Hardware or you have performedon a software itself so all these uhthings regarding to the projects wereasked first of all then there were threepanel members actually one was an HR uhwho was going to ask me to question HRquestion and two of them were atechnical interviewers okay so my likemy uh some of my friends were alsogiving the interview so there the maindomain for there was an internship onwhich internship development like itdepends upon their interest if yourIntel is quite uh like if they want uhto ask more about your internship thenthey will proceed with the same but theywere more in my case they were moreinterested in uh all the like projectactivities although project which I haveperformed because they were all coreprojectsinstrumentation so all those three havedone the internship or uh is theresomeone who is not done an internshipof six months and one of my friend whois also got selected she has been aninternship of one year which is in thesame domain I think uh like uhinternship plays a very important rolein your work placement because you getto sleep yesthe projects you whether you'reperforming on so these are the basicfactors on which they like okay whatthey were looking for the candidate likethe like as you told in JD that uh sickfor the uh confidence in yourcommunication skills like similarlyin interviews uh like I think they justtest your basic knowledgelike basic questions some some of themore technical questions I can tell youwhich they are sports related to ourwhich I have studied in my diploma timesnot in degree so uh they just need toknow your basic because uh like we andtheoretical knowledge like how youexplain or how uh in like how muchdetail you know about the thingslike some of the questions which wereasked for like uh sensors about pressuregauges ultrasonic sensors magneticsensors who they're working principle ortheir operating parameters uh these aresome other question about the walls andall these were some of the technicalquestions which were asked which which Ihave studied in my diploma times noteven in my DP times okay so I think likefor every pressures you are like everyspecial is giving an interview need toknow their basic information about thehistoryokay and what did uh according to GDthey have they mentioned that they needa information you're working in PLC orsensors like something is there anyspecified on that they ask you questionin GD sorry in interview or it wasmainly based on your answers given inthe introductionyeah I'm based mainly based on theanswers which we have given in ourintroductionor the answers which we give like thefurther the question one is dependentupon the answer that we give if we tellthat Aya have used this this whole thenlike what are the parameters of thiswall or its operating waythe other things up according to thatwall so what are the other types or whatis the alternative for a particularsensorso this kind of questions uh they askokay uh did they ask you something uhfrom your internshipuh no[Music]okay just relatedI have done my internship in uh likedata integration part in PL Seasons kindof so basic information about scada andPLC they asked okayrelated to the same like PLC so okay itall comes rightwas you in some activity or somethingno notas one HR as I told so uh so like hementioned and uhsituation and he asked like us with ananswer about it so like he told me thatif me and some of the other senior hasassigned you a similar task so which isa very important and the other day is adue dateso which task you will perform firstaccording tothe like so this it was this was thequestion he asked me so there like Ithink they test your presence of mind orhow uh like how good you are able toanswer to them like convince them for aparticular project so my answer was likeI'll cut like I'll talk to both of youI'll uh let's see which is like I'll askboth of you that which is the which isTask we need which is more important andwe need to uh give it on time or whichcan be delayed a bit little bit moreaccording to the proper communicationandpermissionperformanceI think it's the best answer for thisquestion that's why you are livinginside like projects so we just need tolike put on them that will ask you bothof you you will decide which to do firstokay exactly so I think very less minuteuh remaining for the interview so likeuh can you just brief us about like
