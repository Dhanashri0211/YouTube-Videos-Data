welcome everyone let's talk aboutMicrosoft today when it comes to myportfolio this remains my biggestholding as you can see over here I'veinvested nearly 35000 safety say I like it a lot and thisvideo is going to be super biased thatbeing said right now I'm making severalchanges within my portfolio so if youstick till the end I'll share everythingwith you so why do I like Microsoft somuch I can summarize everything into twomain points the first one is thepositioning of Microsoft Microsoft haspositioned itself as a platform businessand that can compete with anyoneliterally anyone I'm not even jokinghere so just to give you some exampleshere first if you have gaming with Xboxhere they're competing with Sony andNintendo it's essentially three pairsthat being said in my videos I like tobe objective so I should mention onething here welcome to gaming Sony ispretty dominant they have more than 50market share and then we have Xbox andonly then we have Nintendo anotherexample here would be cloudy with Azureso here they're competing with AWS andGoogle Cloud once again only threeplayers I'm sure you might be thinkingwait a second it's not three pairs wehave Alibaba dancing Oracle by do manymore players yes that's true but themarket share isn't significant andthat's why I only mentioned threeplayers and the last example here wouldbe cyber security and this is amulti-billion Dollar business as amatter of fact when it comes to cybersecurity Microsoft is the biggest playerout there and here they're competingwith the likes of Palo Alto fortnitecrowdstrike there are many players outthere now these are just three examplesI could go on and on for example wedidn't talk about productivity we didn'ttalk about advertising they haveLinkedIn they also have the searchbusiness essentially Microsoft is aplatform business and they can competewith literally anyone but thisdefinitely leads us to an importantquestion how is that Microsoft can learnsomething like teams for example andthey can gain millions of customersduring the first year itself I can tellyou that's hard in my case for exampleI've been doing YouTube for more than ayear already and I only have 11 000subscribers can you believe that if youlike to see content like this one forexample do click the Subscribe buttondown below that was smooth wasn't it ifyou like that also click the like buttonbecause this way YouTube actually sharesthis video with more people but comingback to Microsoft the answer is prettysimple Microsoft is able to scale thesebusinesses because of one thing and onething only and that's the Enterprisedistribution and Microsoft controls thatprimarily because of office and Cloud sonow that we know Microsoft secret let'ssee how they use this to compete withother players recently Microsoftlaunched Microsoft designer I'm showingyou what the app can do over here it'sbasically a graphic design app and youcan use that to create anything it couldbe postcards invitations social mediaposts as I said literally anything nowhere's the fascinating part Microsoftdesigner is actually not a new idea as amatter of fact someone else was alreadydoing it and that player is canva canvais already huge they have more than 100million users as a matter of fact if youhaven't checked out canva you shouldit's actually very good for creators nowcan was able to reach 100 million usersbecause it was free before now it's aFreeman business model so now they havea paid here it's around ten dollars mygirlfriend actually has it I wish Icould tell you how many paid membersthey have but they don't disclose thatit's a private company so I can't tellyou the number but last time I checkedthis company had a valuation of 40billion dollars safe to say it's not asmall company now if Microsoft wasreally desperate they could have simplyacquired canva remember they've gotthree Pockets yet in this case theydecide to build their app I'm guessingbecause it was cheaper and easier but Istill didn't tell you the best part hereso Microsoft builds this app now theycould actually sell this separatelybecause remember canva is just one appfor creators and they are charging younine or ten dollars so Microsoft coulddo something similar with Microsoftdesigner and they could charge you fiveor six dollars I'd actually buy thatbecause I use canva on a daily basis butthat's not what Microsoft did Microsoftactually decided to bundle Microsoftdesigner with Microsoft 365. so if youhave Microsoft 365 well guess what youalready get Microsoft designer now thisis interesting because of two thingsfirstly now they already have millionsof customers secondly the bundle ofMicrosoft 365 well guess what thatbecomes more valuable because nowthey're giving you more offerings andthat's why I mentioned Microsoftcontrols the Enterprise distributionbecause of the subscription and that'swhy the business is so good it's thebest platform business out there nowthat's just the business part let's seeif this actually shows up in theirnumbers as well so let's start withsomething basic like the operatingmarches for example do keep in mind thecurrency or that Saturday he joined in2014 so I'll be taking their numberssince 2014. as you can see over herewhen it comes to operating margins themargin profile has improvedsignificantly they went from 30operating margins to 42 of varyingmargins and that's a significant jumpand that's telling you the business isbecoming more efficient literally everyyear as a matter of fact right now myMicrosoft is the most profitablesoftware business out there but the mainquestion here is how how did they gofrom 30 operating margins which by theway is already high to 42 operatingmargins it doesn't seem real well youalready know the answer as I told youMicrosoft controls the Enterprisedistribution so they already have thecustomers they don't need to spend somuch on sales and marketing just do morebusiness with your existing customersand we can clearly see this in theirnumbers let's use Alpha spread here andwe go in the financial section firstlyyou get to see the income statement pickany expense here in this case let's usesales and marketing here you can see inthe last three years cagr just sixpercent here's the fascinating thingMicrosoft was growing Its Top Linebasically Revenue by 12 to 14approximately so your business isgrowing by 14 sales and marketing isonly growing by six percent so obviouslyyour margins are going to expand and Ijust realized I forgot to mention onething here the site I'm using for allthese charts is Alpha spread as you cansee it's very helpful I use this on adaily basis so if you'd like to check itout you'll find the link in thedescription below now coming back toMicrosoft I wanted to mention thisdistribution point because everyonetells me that Microsoft is so expensivewhen you check the be ratio but now youknow why because there are only twocompanies that control the entiredistribution Microsoft controls theEnterprise distribution and applecontrols their retail distribution soit's not a surprise that both thesestocks have outperformed by a widemargin as you can see over here on ayearly basis and also in a five-yearbasis both these stocks have doneextremely well now as I mentioned I liketo be objective in my videos so I shouldhighlight one downside here companieslike apple or Microsoft for examplethey're very stable especially when themarket goes down they actually hold yourportfolio pretty well here's the problemthese companies are not growing by 20 or25 so when the market recovers thesestocks won't go up by 40 or 50 andthat's why I'm trimming my Microsoftposition yes it remains my biggestholding I think it'll remain mappingsholding but I am trimming it as I'mbuying more stocks and that are growingby 30 40 or 50 so when the marketrecovers I'll make a decent gain here soif you'd like to know more about myportfolio my buys my sales my
