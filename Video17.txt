good work-lifebalanceas per the employee survey that isconducted every yearin other way i have personally neverheard anyonefrom the organization to ever complainaboutwork with balance in another way notonly this adobe isalso a very employee-centric companyand it has a host of benefits for itsemployeesone of the major benefit that adobe hasfor its employeesis also known as espp which is known asemployee stock purchase plan which meansthat the employees of adobe are allowedto purchase adobe shares at a highlysubsidized priceup to 25 of their base salary so itmeansthat if you are an employee of adobeapart from getting the stock grants thatthe company will be providing to you aspart of your offeryou can convert some part of your basesalaryand use that to purchase adobe sharesat a highly subsidized rate than what isbeing tradedin the market now let us come anddiscuss about the tech stack of adobemost of the legacy systems that arepresent inadobe are based on c plus being the corebackend languagebeing the core backend language on theother hand there aresome newer solutions newer productnewer features that they are working onand theseare generally java based having somepart of cloud tech in it butfor most intents and purposes the techstack is heavily cplus plus based we will talk about thedifferent levels that are presentin the adobe hierarchy for softwareengineersand

has a worldwideacceptancealthough uh there are quite a bitlegacy products that is present therewhich is written in cplus but then legacy products arepresent almost in every companynot only this the work-life balance ispretty relaxed the work pressure is alsoprettyless in adobe it is a good companyto work at if you want a good work-lifebalanceapart from this you have heard about thecompensation detail ofeach level present in the softwaredevelopment engineer hierarchy and thepay is also quite goodnot only this the stock of adobe as wellas the employee stock purchase plan isactually anadded bonus which increases yourcompensationfurther because you have a possibilityto buyshares at a lower price than the marketand sell them at market priceso all in all i would say that adobe isa great
