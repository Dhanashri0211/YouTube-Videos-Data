- [Narrator] What does a Hollywood film,a podcast,a billboard,and a PDF have in common?They were all made with Adobe products.Across the globe,millions of creative professionalsrely on Adobe softwareto produce their creative work.Adobe's dominanceof the creative software markethas made it one of America'smost valuable tech companies.In 2021, Adobe reporteda record $15.79 billion in revenue.- If you're a creative professional,most likely you've heard of Adobe.- [Narrator] So how has a 40 year-old companymanaged to remain so dominantin the creative software space?This is "The Economics of Adobe."Adobe was founded in 1982by two former Xerox employees,John Warnock and Charles Geschke.Today, Adobe offers a suite of productsthat include: Adobe Illustrator,Reader, Photoshop,Premiere Pro, After Effects,InDesign, and dozens of others.But when it began,Adobe only offered one product, "PostScript,"a programming language designedto print documents on laser printers.(machine whirring)In the early 1980s,most printing was done on dot matrix printerswhich used printed dots to form shapesthat while legible,were blocky and imprecise.When PostScript was released in 1984,it helped jumpstart a revolutionin desktop publishingby allowing users to producetheir own professional-looking content.But Adobe's business hasn't just reliedon developing breakthrough products in-house.To remain competitive over the years,Adobe made dozens of acquisitionsand investments.- I think they look,like a lot of big tech companies,they look to acquisitionsto helping them get into a new product area.- [Narrator] In 1994,the company merged with competitor, Aldus.Aldus' publishing program, PageMaker,and animation software, After Effects,were integrated into Adobe's product line,eventually becoming Adobe InDesignand Adobe After Effects.In 1995, Adobe acquired Photoshop,a program so popular that it's become a verb.Today, the photo editing programis used by over 90%of the world's creative professionalsaccording to Adobe.Later in 2005,Adobe acquired another competitor, Macromedia,which sold a web development toolcalled "Dreamweaver,"and a video player platform called "Flash."Both programs were absorbedinto Adobe's suite of products.- [Narrator 2] All of thisyou can do together in real timewithout stepping on each other's toes.- [Narrator] Most recently,Adobe purchased the design platform, Figma,for $20 billion,the biggest acquisition Adobe has ever made.- So the main thing that stood out to meabout the Figma acquisitionwas the figure of 20 billionfor the companythat was 50x the revenue of Figma,and it really just goes to show youhow much Adobe wanted that company.- [Narrator] Adobe's storyis also one of adaption.In 2011, Adobe beganits much publicized transition,from a provider of one-time purchase productsto a software as a service or SaaS model.- Cloud in subscription,also called "Software as a Service,"or "SaaS,"has completely taken overhow people buy and consume software.You don't buy softwarebut you rent it with a monthly subscription plan.- [Narrator] The big idea behindAdobe's move to the Cloudwas that instead of paying hundredsor thousands of dollars upfrontfor a single product,customers would be able to buya monthly subscriptionat a far lower price.- How has it been going,this transition from package softwareto subscriptions?- A few years ago, Scott,we just decided that we hada unique opportunity to reinvent creative,and what we wanted to dowas provide accessto the entire suite of Adobe softwareat a really affordable priceto a much broader set of customers.- [Narrator] At the time,this switch was considered financially riskysince most of Adobe's revenuecame from physical products.- I think the biggest concern at that time,you have a community of usersthat are used to buying softwarein a certain way,and suddenly they're expectedto pay a monthly feefor just getting access to the software.- [Narrator] In 2013,a change.org petitionto not end Creative Suite 7and force users onto Creative Cloudreceived almost 50,000 signatures.But a decade on,it's clear Adobe's gamble paid off.Since it went all in on the cloud in 2013,Creative Cloud subscriptionshave made up the bulk of Adobe's earnings.In 2021, Adobe subscribersaccounted for 90% of the company's revenue.And despite a recent downturn,today Adobe's stocktrades at almost eight timeswhat it was in 2013.- Adobe switched the cloudworked out phenomenally for them.They went from $4.2 billion in annual salesback in 2011to that being theirrevenue they're bringing in for the quarter.Now, instead of just gettinga one-time acquisition customer,customers be paying every month for years.(gentle music)
