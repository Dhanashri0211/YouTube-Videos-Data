andtoday responsibility but it's a goodfeeling in itself it's thinkingcapabilityand if i have to put in simple termscompany has given you a bigger leverthan before to change things and movethings around so yeah that is the majordifference that i feelabsolutely well said i mean i think akbearlier we used to just code you keepbill clinton inow you understand from a businessperspective key this is a businessproblem that you're targeting and theoptimalnow it is up to us which language youwant to choose which framework do youwant to work in so you have to designthe architectures you are activelyinvolved in that so i mean whole a lotof things that you have to you know takeinto consideration multiple factors nowyou can be very happy thinking aboutbuddy business problemthere will be a much wider impact on thebusiness soathe interesting questions comes in a waylanguagesat the time of joining the job and thereare rapidly technologies revolving andupdatingeven the c pluses versions are gettingnewer in advance so how do you keep upwith that how do you cope up with thischanging environment rapidly changingtechnological environment right so imean very interesting question thereason being the only thing that canhelp you to you know keep up with thechanging technologies and every day youare learning new new technologies arecoming in puranai mean people think some of the freshersthink about the besti mean the only thing that helps you isa very growth and open mindseti mean you need to very clearlyunderstand key logic matters not thelanguageright from the beginning we are taughtkey as a fresher whatever language youyou chooseif i give you my examplei mean as a fresher i used to code injava and dsabuti've learned and worked with pythonjango then react then golang then js soi mean a whole you know wide variety oflanguages that i've worked with and it'snot that i am somebody who is veryexceptional minded on all that i amsimilar to what other people are theyare also learning so we should be veryopen to learning all the time that isthe only way to deal with that scenariosotherwise if you are stuck with onelanguageso that is a wrong mindset you should bevery eager to learn at the very sametime you should be very open-mindedwe will be i mean language is not abarrier in the end because you can learnlanguage on the go the only thing ismost of my help is coming from stackoverflow and google itself like half ofthe time i am doing that so yeahso yeah right moving on since you havebeen working at ruby for a longer timeyou might be well aware of that so whatare the various perks that you get atworking at adobe what are those thingsthat you like about it and you feel veryexceptional about it yeah yeah sofirstly i'm i mean adobe i literallyadore my company i'm not saying itbecause the you know interview is beingrecorded but anyway if you ask meanywhere on the cameras outside of thisi love my company reason being i meanhere first of all it is a very beautifulpolicy like adobe for all so you feelvery inclusive it's not like dominatedby a certain you know community and allit's like you feel very comfortable youfeel very safe while walking i mean theyare very acceptable to who you are andthey don't just try to change youbehavei mean whichever way you just bring indiversity so that is something that theyare very inclusive about that you get towork with a lot of bright minds here whoare very not only bright but they arevery kind and humble people so as a workculturefriendly hairboti have had certain discussions in myteam where very senior people were thereand i was asked my opinion so i meanthis is something which is verybeautiful thing that you are asking imean even in my earlier daysi mean you get to speak what you thinkand there have been you know certainscenarios wherein i said some some ofthe things i think differently maybe andthey accepted that opinion so simon theyare very welcoming in their sense sowork culturehashtag adobe life is something which ireally enjoy apart from that there are alot of benefits like they are verysupportive about wellness so they givecertain amount every year for us to imean take care of our health and pursueour hobbies so i mean there are otherleads like i mean other normal leavesvacation leaves sick leave casual leaveswhich all the companies give so theyalso give and their bereavement is likeyou where you faced any loss recently inthe family and also you can take thesethose and they're very interesting thesethat they have added recently that isthe pandemic leaves so up to i think 20leaves you can take in a year and youcan just relax and make sure that youare physically and mentally fine andthere i mean during the pandemic theyalso gave well-being these mental healthand well-being these so this issomething i mean they are very kind ofthey try to you know some eggsthank you i mean this is the need of theheart so they will just adaptaccordingly those time people'sthey understand clear employees so theyneed to take care of their family theyhave been really supportive during thepandemic and i mean other things likeeternity paternity leaveso i mean a whole lot of things flexibleworking hours i mean you can just go atyour own comfortable time and come backput a time offthey will not be just sayingthat they are very comfortable they makeyou feel comfortable hello they don'task much they give you your own spacebut they don't try to get into yourspace and all that so i mean it's awonderful place for the healthy workersthat i feel yeah i think this is thebest part of it companysay on record or off record the employeeis raising it so that means the companyhas done their job well done as anemployee this is the best thing you candoneeds to understandit's not that key you are working injust direction to make more profits andget with maximum productivity of everyemployee is that you have to care abouttheir mental wellness their physicalwellness you feel valued in the team sothat's a very very different feeling andthat brings in the loyalty i would sayright you feel like you belong here imean you are valued just like in yourhome when there are five people sittingaround the table and they're discussingthe topic over dinner so similar feelingthat you get you know you are in aconference room there are maybe 15people there are different designationbut leave aside everything they justtreat you like you are working on theproject so your opinion matters so youspeak there earlier as the fresher youthinkbut they you know inspire you to sayyour thing to put forth your point youknow what you think about a thing sowhich is the beauty which is like youare trying to make the person feelinclusive at the very same time you areaccepting what they are saying or whatthey are thinking and you are you knowvaluing their opinions so this issomething which i really liked yeah ithink this is the best way you havesome more possibilities you are alsotaking in new perceptions you aresharing your own perception about thething at all this brings more kind ofinclusion and i think when the persongrows this is the culture that the otherperson will also inculcate and recommendamong juniorssupportive inclusionjuniorsokaythey will also try to maintain thathierarchy maintain that culturebecause i feel adobe's that workplacei have to work at adobe and that's whyso i would definitely recommend ifanybody is looking out there looking fora job do please because that is one ofthe finest place that you will beworkingyou get paid well you are treated wellso recently i also received the spotreward which is like on the basis ofperformance that you've worked on anyspecial project then you have gone aboveand beyond you know your limits toactually bring the best out of it sothese are the things that are there inadobe and maybe other companies as wellwhichbasically to inspire people to you knowget out of their comfort zones and thinkuh the bigger picture and try to come upwith the best solution possible so imean such a rewards are also there yeahand congratulations for getting thataward i thinkit's well deserved yeah and this is whatit makes like cupcake employees brandambassadors and it's is that that whenyou start understanding and valuing worklife balance or these culture cookieapko milra and somebody else is notgetting that then you start valuing thatso i think it makes a lot of differenceover here so with this i come to the endof this part one of this podcast andmoving on to the part two of it which ismore around the rapid fire questions sothere will be a mix of more professionaland personal questions on the rapid fireso yeah starting with a very very simpleone what kind of a os person you are foryour work as inmac os windows or linux linux i thinkokay what kind of os person for phoneare you an iphone person or an androidperson iphone persondefinitely recently i have i mean iswitched to iphone earlier i was anandroid person but yeah okay yeah i hopeyou are liking the thingsyeah kind of yes the camera is very goodyeahi think that is one of the reason thatmost of my friends a lot of peoplechange that because that has one of thebest cameras right so right i mean ilike photography as well so i get toexplore different you know modes and allso it's very good yeah exactly it's thesame for me as well so even one of myfriend who was not into photography butwhen he switched to iphone he starteddoing that and like started his owninstagram page for photography and allthose things and now he's moreinterested in clicking photos of us oras in groups[Laughter]yeah moving forward what kind ofdevelopment that you like i think backend or franklin so i have not exploredfront end as such so back in i would saybut it's not that i am against the frontend i would love to explore it more yeahas of now backhand is more preferablebut definitely if things come to passiontesting comes you will a person-friendlyyeah yeah okay what kind of a workperformance that you have as in workfrom home or work from office so i meana third maybe hybrid culture perhapsoptional in terms of if you want to goto office it's fine if you want to stayat home after all i mean i thinkproductivity matters so for me it shouldbe hybrid yeah i think that that's thebest way right any preference on thelocation india or abroad so i mean sincemy entire experience has been in indiaonly i would very much love to exploreabroad as well i am open to thatdirection as well so i mean i'm happywith both but would be open okay anyspecific country that you would want towork at is in abroad i mean i very muchlike new zealand and australia so yeahthere fingers crossed rightyeahgood any preference on startup or mnc soagain as long as i'm comfortable workingwhere i am working i like the workculture i am valued there i feel likei'm belonging here and i like the workand overall i mean things so i'm open toboth i'm in startup seminci it doesn'tmatter for me yeahi i feel that you're feeling verydiplomaticallyno no not at all i mean right from thebeginning i have i've been very clear imean i gave interviews for the startupsand mncs and the best i get i will moveto that so it's only that yeah but to behonest i think that's that's the bestpart of it because you're not restrictedby something as in i only want to workat startup i only want to work at mncright you're exploring your options andyou're open to things that come in yourway which makes you feel valued whichcreates a very good impact in yourgrowth and everything so yeah i thinkthat's also great i mean i'm very opento you know starting i can work in astartup where only five people are therecurrently as long as i'm very muchmotivated about the way and the idea andthe vision that they're working towardsmaybe tomorrow i am one of the you knowtop the first five people who joined theteam and now it is like thousands ofother employees are there so i would behappy to i'm involved with such aculture but i am not against mmc'seither i am working in mncs for the lastthree years now so yeah i am open toevery such opportunity so cool so coolyeah so moving forward to more personalquestions so what kind of a person youare a beach person or a mountain personpeach person any special beach that isyour favorite one anjuna beachsecond one are you
