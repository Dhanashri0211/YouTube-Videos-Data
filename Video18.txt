Hi guys, I'm Nishant Chahar. Welcome back to my channel.And in today's video, we are going to discuss Amazon's salary structure.We recently made a video, Apple one.And got a very good response on that.And a lot of people commented on different companies.That make one for Uber, #, and Amazon.So let's discuss Amazon today.Will shortly make on others as well.Because the procedure of research takes a lot of time,is supposed to go through a lot of articles, is supposed to check on several websites.Then supposed to make an average outcome like this and this.So, In the video, we will tell about both the Lower and the upperthat you will be getting within this range.And will also tell you after calculating on per month basis for both.Other than this, how many RSUs you will be getting, and how much joining bonus you will be getting?And will explain these terms respectively that exactly what it is.But before that, if you think that CTC divided by 12 is your per month salary, then it's not.The final salary that you will be receiving in your bank account is not CTC/12.If you still think that this is it, so please it's not what it is. So, take care. Okay.Now let's proceed and will let you know how everything happens actually.So, let's start the video without any further delay.We will talk first about SDE1,Fresh out of college, if you are in any college and you get any offer either off campus or on campus from Amazonthen, How much salary you will be getting?This is the data from last year, from those who joined Amazon last year in 2022,there are maximum chances of the data points may increase more next year,because of the current salary of SDE1 in general, Amazon has changed its whole band currently.So, this is possible that this may increase more.So, I'm telling it first.Okay, so now the base salary you will be getting here is 15.5 Lakh rupees.Now, What is the base salary? Let me make you know that first.So, the Base salary is that, which after getting divided by 12 is transferred to your bank account per month after taxes reduction. Okay.So, 15.5 Lakh rupees divided by 12 is getting transferred to your bank account per month.Guys, the next thing that you get is the Joining Bonus.In 1st year you get a joining bonus of 9.5 Lakh rupees and 2nd year it is 6 Lakh rupees.Now on Amazon, your Joining Bonus is credited along with your salary in your bank account.So, you won't be getting 9.5 Lakh rupees right away.You'll be getting it per month. i.e., 9.5 lakhs divide by 12 and you will be getting it per month along with your Base salary.So, the Final salary that you will be receiving in your bank account isJoining Bonus + Base Salary that would be around 2 Lakh rupees per month, okay.So, Amazon is paying Joining Bonus a lot.Because your base salary changes after the experience, for those who joined last year their base salary has been changedand everyone's base salary has become like 20-21 Lakhs for SDE1.So the next thing that I've seen on several websites is that your Base Salary can be even @28 Lakhs.But in that case, the Joining Bonus is reduced, So your Joining Bonus for 1st year will be 4 lakhs and for 2nd year 3.5 Lakh rupees.So your overall final amount that is credited to your bank account, will be around 2.8 Lakh rupees.This is after the experience, this is not Fresher's salary.This is after experience salary.So don't get confused.Apart from this, your last component is your RSU's which are Restricted Stock Units.What are Restricted Stock Units?You are getting Stock of the company, but here Why is it restricted?Because you can't sell it at once and some of your percentages used to go in #.# means, stocks that you get at some percent off, now you can sell them.Okay, So the # period is generally of 4 years.In Amazon, the Stock's split has been done quite weirdly.So, in 1st year you only get 5%, next year 15 % and In the last two years you get 40-40% respectively.So, this is quite a tricky scheme that you must not leave Amazon before 2 years.So, the stocks that freshers are 143 stocks, okay?. Now, the stock price after the stock's becomes around 110 i.e.,$110.So, you can calculate the rest. So, you will be getting the 5% of it. It doesn't matter that much for 1st year.In 3rd year, it matters.And when you get promoted so your these stocks, RSU's you start getting it more in the form of refreshers and your stock's component used toincrease rapidly, when we will get to SDE3. You'll get to see how many stock component is there.So now let's move to SDE2.So guys we are having a giveaway on our channel, there is a giveaway of 2 things, you must know.iPad and Samsung's Tab, so for that you will have to do a very important step which is to book yourself a free trial on Crio's website.Many people didn't do it, so go and do it definitely because that is one of the most important things,from that email, I will be contacting you with which you have registered there.If you haven't already booked your free trial, so the link is in the description go and definitely do it.Okay guys, before proceeding in the video here is a message for you from today's video sponsor.Crio.DoWhat is Crio.Do?It is a project-based learning platform, While making projects here you will be learning new technologies.Now guys Crio is worth leading work experience-based platform.Which will help you to crack jobs of Full Stack and Back End with your dream CTC ofmaximum 6-40 Lakh rupees with 3k+ learners and 500+ Gradsplaced in Global MNCs, Unicorns, and Hypergrowth startups like Amazon, Groww, Trade, Flipkart, and Paytm.The Grads of Crio used to get at least 89% of the hike on average.In Crio, you'll be learning development in the way you will be doing in a full-time job.Okay, now whenever you'll be choosing stack whether it is Full stack or Back-end developmentand after that, if you'll be working on real-life projects.

Now the next component in this is yourRSUs, here you get RSU's of around 28 Lakhs, and here also the same scene happens as in SDE1,you will be getting stocks in the ratio of 5%, 15% 40%, and 40%.And after that the upper band of SDE2, whose Base Salary is around 51 Lakh rupees and can get a Joining Bonus of 20 Lakhs.And the Joining Bonus for the next year will be 15 Lakhs.Okay, other than this the value of your RSUs can also go up to 47-48 Lakh rupees.So you'll see great variation here.It depends on the number of years you have worked, how was your interview round, and if you have a competing offer or not, Okay.So these are never standard for SDE1 and SDE3 and these are ranges, they can't pay after the range and whatevercomponents are there, they are divided in the particular ratio that if you will increase one componentthen the second one will decrease automatically.So they have a Bar of Total Compensation that they can give certain maximum compensation only for a role.So for SDE2, it can go up to 80-90 Lakhs, they can't give more than this,If you will try to go above this like increasing the Base salary then your stocks will decrease,If you will increase the joining bonus then Base Salary will decrease, so they maintain a ratio.So In Amazon minimum per month salary for SDE2 is around 4.25 Lakhs.This is after including the Joining bonus because that is also divided by 12 and is the Base Salary. This is the minimum that I got on the Internet.It is possible that it can be less than this, but it won't.Because generally when someone goes to SDE2 from SDE1 then the salary almost got doubled.So this is there that it will surely go from 15.5 - 30+ Lakhs. So don't worry about that.So after this, there's a maximum band that goes up to 6 Lakh Rupees per month (5.91 Lakh rupees).Now the last one that is left is SDE3,And to become SDE3 takes a lot of time. They are L-6 engineers in Amazonand this can take around 8-9 years. Some also become within 6-7 years, but in rare cases only.People are achieving this salary after a lot of experience and even if they are coming from some other company they must have certain experienceand previous compensation must be around this. It also has ranges.But I didn't get very much information about this. I got around 1-2 and I'm telling this on the basis of that and letting you know the basic thingsYes, it can go above that, maybe a little lower. But will surely go above this.So the Base Salary is around 80 Lakh rupees per month, okay.This also goes around 1-1.2 Crores and also can be among 60-65 Lakhs.So this is the Base Salary of SDE3, other than this the joining bonus you will be getting is 65 Lakh rupees for 1st year and 55 Lakhs for 2nd year.So they divide the compensation of Base and joining bonus in the ratioIf they will increase your Base Salary too much as you have performed well in your rounds, then will decrease your joining bonus a bit.So that your per month component will be almost the same, so here the per month salary you will be receiving would be around 12 Lakh rupees.Okay but this is after 8-9 years of experience. This is not a college fresher’s Salary.Keep that in mind always and this has recently become too much.Recently Amazon has changed the Whole Salary structure around in the last 4-5 months.That's why this has increased so much, it was not that much before, Okay.So take care of this too and finally RSU's component is also too much for SDE3.So that can go from 80 Lakh rupees to 1.5 Crore rupees, Okay.In this also stock percentage is like 5%, 15%, 40% & 40%. But this is what you'll get when you join. And this is all your scene.Other than this when you get some increments, your increments vary within the range of 5-15%.This time there were too many increments in Amazon around 30-40% and promotions were around 100%, for them the salary hike was 100-150%.So that is a different case, but generally, the annual increment used to be around 5, 10 & 15%.So this was the whole video, you can comment on your dream company and can also suggest which company you want to know about.SDE1, SDE2, SDE3.There are more levels out there, you can check that on levels.fyi.There used to be principal Engineers, they are the next level.So this is the whole scene, so after becoming SDE2 when you get some experience so people used to move to managers position.So we can bring their salary structures as well if you want to know.So this was it for the video. Thank you so much for watching, let's meet in the next video. Till then, Bye.
