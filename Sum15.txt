The service-lip video is about service-based companies like Accenture, TCS, Bipro, Congregant and Capgemini . The best thing that I liked about Accenture was that I didn't have certification before I went to Accenture to get more attention to the job . But, the best thing is that if you are doing well in the project, you will get a good variable, it will depend on your manager . If you feel that this is not right, you can change the project that you want, too .
