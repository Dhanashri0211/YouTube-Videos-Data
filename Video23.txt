hi everyone welcome to my channel andtoday we'll talk about hexaware sohexover is a cmm level 5 but it isoperator from india so it's indian mnchaving more than 10 000 plus employeeandthey have good number of projects andgood number of clients they are operatedfrom chennai and pune andgurgaon also so few few cities they havea footprint and they have office outsideof india so if you are joining xorpossibly you may get an on-siteopportunity also uh so their interviewprocess it is slightly difficult becausethey have normally one to two rounds ofcoding test coding test as in you willbe shared a link uh for so suppose youare a developeruh a full stack developer possibly thenyou will be shared uhpossibly java or dotnet or python orangularlink withsomemultiple choice and some coding test soyou need to run some you need to writesome code and to compile it and you needto run the test cases so if you able toscore around 50 to 60 percent uhmore than 60 percent i think you willable to get a call so that is the firstuh process and they will be having onemore round for technical and if you arejoining as a senior resource you canhave one more technical with thearchitect so you may expect around twoto three rounds of technical uh two inrounds of technical interview one roundof machine test or uh online testand then the hr uh willcall with a hr so process is quitelengthy but it is smooth but it isslightly difficult the reason being theykept it difficult is like you know theythey are kind of something mostly ithink they are kind of a body shoppingsometimes they used touh send their employee to the clientlocation or they used to directly workwith the client so if you are not ableto perform well then they need to likeyou know terminate your employment so ifyou are not very sure about yourtechnology or about your role don'tdon't join this company they have alittle bad reputation in the market inyoutube if you start some video you cansee some of the employees get terminatedbut that that due to like you knowlonger notice period and longer benchperiod so nobody would accept like youknow more than 90 days bench period theywill try to allocate in a project but itis since it is not like that or tcs oraccenture well you will have a lot ofproject you can easily switch if you arenot able to perform in one project youcan get release and you can try to dotry to explore your opportunity in thenext project but here in hexawas sincethis company is little small so thatopportunity you might not get so if youare only sure that you are hardcoretechnical or if you are uh joining sucha role maybe uh which you have alreadydone if like that isn't being don't fakelike you you cannot escape basically ifyou are joining from hex hex aware fromsome other company you may switch hereand there and try to like you know grabsome knowledge but here from the day oneyou need to perform they will give alaptop and whatever job is expected theywill ask you to deliver from the veryfirst day so that is my suggestion ifyou are having a plan to join excel andone more thing xor does provide decentsalary so compared to uh other servicebased company they used to provideslightly higher salarybut one more bad point is they don'tprovide that much of good hike so evenif you are joining xo where in uh inmiddle i mean maybe uh lateral entrythen try to grab as much as possible butbecause your next text could be veryminimal like it would be between one tofive percent so that is uh one problemof x over now we'll talk about the uh ofa letter first then i'll go to thejoining bonus part partso offer letters is very basic like theyhave only three pages of a letter notmuch so this position is offered systemanalyst g5 band system analyst uh meanslike is a technical lead so they havethisuhlike you know name as a system analystbut it is a technical lead after thatthey have a architect rolethe system analyst if perform wellthey'll promote it to architect rule andthis is a puny office this basicallytheir head office they operated frommumbai basically maharashtra and this ispretty muchlike new offer letter and if you seeother terms and condition they havementioned not muchand theexciting part is to see their salarybreakdown so this this is again simpleuh the basic component 55 000 rupees andno uh monthly components we will see theannual component it's 6.6 which is inturn 55000 hr is 50 percent of that so 3like 30 000 straightforward convenienceis nineteen thousand so if you dividedby twelve i think eighteen hundred permonth which is uhagain like a standard one and rest allthey are giving us flexi component sothis nine point five lakhs you will geta flexi component so that you can divideyou know you can go with the lta you cantake the food coupon you can do a lot ofother reimbursement with this amount sothat you can save taxand then medical allowances is 15 000rupeesso 1250 per month so19.74 is a fixed component which ispretty good at this uh like you knowpointand then in like in terms of pune alsothis salary is decentnow variable pay they have uh fivepercent variable pay of their fixedcomponent so one point one is one lakhone thousand ten thousand is variablepay but i have heard like they don't paythe entire amount soit is depend on your performance andcompany performance and again like yourproject performance so if you you mayexpect around 80 to 90 000 but post testtax it will be under 60 000now you need to paylike 3500 per year contribution as yourmedical coverage so that is pretty muchless i think 3500 per year risk is lessand this amount33 000 rupees for gratuity and 12percent of the basic around 80 000 yourpf so 1.12 will be deducted but againlike this pf anyway will bedeposited your pf account but hisgraduate is something that you need tospend approximate five years in order toget the advantage of graduatingotherwise this money will been forfeitedso that is 10 point to a 22 lakhs ctcthat they have shown and if you see uhsome more uh notes here basically theyhave told like a saturday morning itwill be applicable per month with yourwith your with your salary so statutorybonus is not something which is theseperformance bonus it is it will be comesunder this one like you know flexibucketso now also they told about the graduategraduate it will be like you know itwill be as per the government law so weneed tospend five years so it is not five yearsexactly for us it is uhfour point ten years exactlyso that is all about hexa where payslipnow if i go to the joining bonuscomponent so if you are joining earlymake sure you ask for the joining bonusthey will not add this joining bonusinto the offer letter but they willshare a joining bonus laterand that is must like if you have thejoining bonus letter only if you'll getthe money otherwise not so if you seethe joining bonushereso they actually offered joining bonusof 50 000 one time joining bonus of 50000 rupees so when you are joining thatorganization make sure you haveuh like you know have aaccepted uh you accepted this and thenyou get signed and you it is signed bythe hr like that there is onboarding hrwho is uh who is that time available youjust do a proper shine if you are notuh if you are having a virtualonboarding that make sure you takeauthorization from your virtualizationthat you got ajoining bonus and this joining bonuswill process your first month salary andthen if you are resigning your or yourterminating your employment within 12months or if they are terminating on theperformance ground so they have addedthis laws that i have told if you arenotso sure please do not join this companybecause uh they can 10 minute employeebased on their performance in very firstyearso uh they theyyou need to pay back that particularamount if you are uh like not stayingmore than 12 12 months so that is allabout hx award it's a pretty decentcompanyuhto work with and if you need moreinformation from information
