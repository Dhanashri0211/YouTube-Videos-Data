The why ask question may be even more important when interviewing with a firm like Accenture than it is with strategy firms like McKinsey, Bing and DCG, the MBB firms . HAB firms know that if you get an offer, you are likely to accept because there are prestigious names to have on your resume .

The company has 700,000 employees which 1s more than 20 times the size of McKinney .
